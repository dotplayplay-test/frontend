            <h2>What is the bankroll?</h2>
            <div class="help-content">
                <p>The bankroll is the pool of money that the bankroller uses to pay out winners of the game.</p>
                <p>The max profit that players can win from a round of the game is determined by the size of the bankroll. The larger the bankroll, the more players can win.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each player can only win 0.75 % of the bankroll per round</li>
                    <li>All players can only win 1.125% of the funds per round</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Players can bet on the bankroll (i.e. become bankrollers), and their bet is added to the bankroll such that they win when the house wins and they lose when the house loses.</p>

            <h2>How does the pool of funds operate? </h2>
            <div class="help-content">
                <p>The bankroll implements a shareholding system that allows everyone to participate and obtain the corresponding shares.</p>
                <p>
                    <b class="cl-primary">The house edge is 1%.</b>
                    99% of each bet will go to the bankroll, and the remaining 1% will be reserved for platform operating costs.
                </p>
                <p>Payouts made to the winning players will be deducted from the bankroll.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>How does leverage investment work?</h2>
            <div class="help-content">
                <p>We'll add the selected multiplier to your initial investment ( minus dilution fee ). If the Bankroll goes down and your initial investment goes to 0, you're get liquidated and you lost your investment.</p>
                <p>Hint: You can also use this feature as an Off-Site investment.</p>
                <p>Let's make an example:</p>
                <p>Let's say have 1 Bitcoin. You could deposit them to your Account and invest them all. You would now be entrusting your whole 1BTC to NANOGAMES.IO, with the associated risks. Alternatively, you could deposit just 0.1 BTC of them, invest them, and then tell the site "I have 0.9 more BTC that I want to invest". You keep those coins safe in your own wallet with your own private key, but they are counted as part of the Game bankroll.
                    Your share of the bankroll and your share of the site's profits and losses is the same as if you had invested your whole 1BTC. If the site should have a run of bad luck such that your 0.1 BTC goes to 0, You'll get liquidated and your leverage will be set to 0. In that way, you can never get into debt with the site but you can deposit again and keep your share of the bankroll.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>What is the bankroller dilution fee?</h2>
            <div class="help-content">
                <p>Every time you invest in the bankroll, 2 % of your investment will be distributed to the bankrollers who joined before you, according to their shares in the bankroll.</p>
                <p>Similarly, every time bankrollers who joined after you invest in the bankroll, you get a portion of the 2 % of their investment.</p>
                <p>For example, if you invest 1 ETH in the bankroll, 2 % of your investment (0.02 ETH) will be the be distributed to the bankrollers who joined before you, and the remaining 98 %（0.98 ETH）will be confirmed as your share.</p>
                <p>The earlier you invest in the bankroll, you more you’ll benefit from the dilution fee system. As this is our way to reward long-time bankrollers. You’re never too late to join us!</p>
