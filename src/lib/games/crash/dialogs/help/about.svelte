        <h2>What Is CRASH?</h2>
        <div class="help-content">
            <p>CRASH is an online multiplayer blockchain guessing game that made as an increasing curve that may crash at any time.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>How To Play It?</h2>
        <div class="help-content">
            <p>Before the game starts, you have 6 seconds to place your bet. After the game starts, the multiplier will get higher and higher starting from 1X.</p>
            <p>You can click on "Cash Out" at any time to lock in the current multiplier, and your payoff will be your bets times the current multiplier.</p>
            <p>The longer you stay in the game, the higher payoff you will get. Please be noted, however, that the curve may crash at any moment. If you fail to cash out before the crash, you will lose all your bets.</p>
            <p>Are you going to cash out at 1.01x, or are you going to stay until 100x、1000x、10000x...? It’s all your call – which has to be made in a split of a second! (This game is not for the weak-hearted).</p>
