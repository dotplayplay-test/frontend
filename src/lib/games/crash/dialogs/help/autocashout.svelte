        <h2>Why Is There Internet Lag?</h2>
        <div class="help-content">
            <p>Since CRASH is a real-time online game (a game in which customers interact with it via the Internet), there is a delay between the time you click on the “Cash Out”
                button and the time when the server receives your cash out instruction.
            </p>
            <p>The farther away you are from the server and the worse your Internet connection is,
                the longer it will take for your message to reach the game server.
            </p>
            <p>In a perfect environment, your message can travel to the server at the speed of light, but it still takes 134 milliseconds to travel around the world.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>What's the Use of Automatic Cash Out?</h2>
        <div class="help-content">
            <p>The best way to avoid damages caused by Internet lag is to use the automatic cash out function. Since your automatic cash out is sent to the server
                at the same time when you place your bet, the server can execute your cash out instruction precisely and regardless of the lag.
            </p>
            <p>For example, if your connection is bad and you want to cash out at 2x, then we recommend that you set automatic cash out to 2x rather than cash out manually
                at 2x, because after you click on “Cash Out”, the curve may crash before your message reaches the server.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>What Should You Do If the Game Is Accidentally Disconnected?</h2>
        <div class="help-content">
            <p>When we notice that you are disconnected from an active game, we will try to cash out for you.</p>
            <p>However, we strongly recommend that you use the automatic cash out function to deal with this issue.</p>
            <p>Since your automatic cash out multiplier has been sent to the server, you can still cash out normally
                even if you are completely disconnected. This is the most reliable way to avoid damages caused by accidental disconnection.
